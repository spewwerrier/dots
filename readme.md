## Keybind
Logic behind keybind is windowing related keybinds like launching programs, switching 
window, resizing and moving windows, all starts with `super` key. Application shortcuts
are with `alt` or combination with `ctrl`.
Wezterm relies on `alt-x` as prefix keys example: `alt-x c` to open new tab in wezterm.

- Super + Return => terminal
- Super + Space => program launcher
- Super + d => search in browser
- Super + s => search in documentation
- Super + c => toggle waybar
- Window keybinds are all defined in hypr/keybinds.conf
